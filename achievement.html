    <td><p>Detroit's own Melissa Butler is a woman on the rise. As a graduate of Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, graduating with a degree in business, she took her talents to Wall Street shortly after graduation. While in New York, she envisioned her own make up line that praises black women and their diverse skin. Thus, The Lip Bar was born. Working for years to get her company to take off, she decided to propose her idea on the hit show, Shark Tank. They did not like the idea and turned her away. However, she proved persistence is key by launching her own <a href="https://www.thelipbar.com/" target="_blank"> website </a> and becoming recognized by Target. She is now selling her makeup online at Target.com. She is definitely an inspiration to young black women. Check her out!</p></td>
