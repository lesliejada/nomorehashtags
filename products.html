          <p>Shea Moisture is a hair product line that is receiving a lot of buzz in the natural hair community. They carry sets of shampoos and conditioners tailored to whatever hair needs the user has, just check out the bottle. Moisture retention shampoo/conditioner combo is recommended for the naturalista that spends majority of her time in protective styles. This combo is bound to bring those dry curls back to life. Priced at $11.99 at your local beauty supply, it is worth every penny. </p>

          <p>Now when I first heard of the Aunt Jackie's line, I thought it was a knock off of the Miss Jessie's (I still refuse to break the bank for anything that expensive) but I gave this one a go. Priced at $10 even this had my twist out poppin', honey! It does just as the name suggests and has me saying "Curl la la" everytime I use it. Give it a go. You won't be disappointed.</p>

          <p>Back at it again with the Shea Moisture line and while you can probably find coconut oil cheaper than this one, I was product happy one day and bought it. The label says it's good for H2T use like any other coconut oil but I combined this with my bathing routine and my skin feels baby smooth. Living in Michigan, once it gets cold, it gets COLD and it is so hard to maintain helathy skin. But I think I'll keep this one around. It's priced at $14.99 at your local Target or beauty supply so give it a try. </p>
