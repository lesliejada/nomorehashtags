    <p> Over 200 black people have been killed at the hands of police in 2016 alone. With social media becoming so popular, people around the nation show their support by hashtagging the victim's name. It is time to become informed and safe. I hate going online and seeing a hashtag in front of a new name. I don't want to see NO MORE HASHTAGS.

We strive to connect our users with entertaimment they may find interesting and would like to pass along.

It is time to become informed and uplift one another in these trying times. </p>
