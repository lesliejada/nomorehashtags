   <p> Dylann Roof's recent appearance in court </p>
   <p> Dylann Roof, the shooter of the Charleston Church Massacre that occurred on June 17, 2015, appeared in court last week, representing himself. During the court session, the judge spent an hour overlooking evidence from the shooting, including bullet casings and pictures of the vitims and their lifeless bodies in the church. The judge informed the family members if it became to gruesome, they were allowed to leave the court room and return when they were ready. The families understood but stayed the entire time. The one person who seemed to have trouble looking at the evidence was the Dylann, himself. Throughout the hour of overlooking the footage, it was said he would close his eyes or attempt to put his head down. </p>
   <p> On December 9, 2016, he returned to court and pled guilty following a chuckle. Roof faces 33 federal charges: nine counts of violating the Hate Crime Act resulting in death; three counts of violating the Hate Crime Act involving an attempt to kill; nine counts of obstruction of exercise of religion resulting in death; three counts of obstruction of exercise of religion involving an attempt to kill and use of a dangerous weapon; and nine counts of use of a firearm to commit murder during and in relation to a crime of violence.</p>

  <p>If convicted, he could face the death penalty. </p>
